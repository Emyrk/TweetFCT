Below is the Twitter ID for @factombot and the chain_ID on the Facom testnet we have been writing to for testing.
Automating these will be critical to future work and establishing a robust software package. If you wish to track a different
account on the same chain you can change the user id here to twitter id you wish to follow, but you will also have to generate
a new chain first before you can change the chain id.

        1. factomd --> we activated this earlier

            a.) name --> twitter handle (@factombot)

            d.) public --> the string of the randomly generated public key used to sign (will correspond to identifier for person
            submitting tweet to the Factom blockchain at a later time)
